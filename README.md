# Star Wars Coding Challenge

## Using SWAPI: https://swapi.py4e.com/

## Created using React

### Basic Single Page Application that allows you to search for a character name and then retrieves all relevant character information from the API.

### You can also just type in a single letter, and you will receive a selectable list of results which all have their corresponding profile information. 

### If you type in an invalid phrase, you will be prompted with an error and must search again. 

### Thanks to @LifewayIT for the creative challenge.
